      <p>We want Django Sprint in Krak√≥w to be enjoyable for all participants.
        That is why we're adopting PyCon's Code of Conduct.

      <p>We value the participation of each member of the Python community and
        want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
        Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to
        other attendees throughout the sprint.

      <p>To make clear what is expected, all sprint participants are required to
        conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this
        code throughout the event.

      <h2>The short version</h2>

      <p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free sprint experience for
        everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
        appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment
        of sprint participants in any form.

      <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
        including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
        imagery is not appropriate.

      <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
        professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
        exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for our sprint.

      <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the the sprint at
        the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

      <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

      <h2>The longer version</h2>

      <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
        talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
        sexual attention.

      <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
        comply immediately.

      <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist,
        and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.
        Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for the
        sprint.

      <p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of
        conduct, the sprint organizers may take any action they deem
        appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
        sprint.

      <h2>Contact information</h2>

        or have any other concerns, please find Tomek Paczkowski or Ola
        Sendecka, both will be very visible during sprint.
